# JobSearchFrance
Tool to search on the Indeed job board for France

1. Install Jupyter Lab on your machine: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html

2. Run Jupyter Lab.

3. Run the "IndeedFrance" notebook.

4. Download CSV file and upload it to a cloud (OneDrive for Business in my case).

5. Connect your BI tool (such as Power BI) to your cloud.

6. Reprocess the Notebook every 3 days to have an update on job posted (do not forget to copy/paste again the CSV file in the cloud).

Be careful: If your request does not work, wait for a 15-20 minutes as Indeed stop recognizing your process as a bot.
